This is a very simple sinatra app, built to be run on heroku.

It has only one endpoint: /locate , that returns a JSON with the location of the IP address of the requester (using MAXMIND's free location database).

# Running locally

git clone REPO
bundle install
bundle exec ruby geolocate.rb

# Pushing to your own heroku instance

git clone REPO
cd REPO
heroku create
heroku addons:add newrelic:standard
heroku config:add RACK_ENV=production
git push heroku master
